# Getting Started with [Service]
In the `` Main.java `` file, write the Java code for your service.
```bash
mvn compile # This command compiles your Java source code.
```


```bash
mvn package # This command packages your service into a JAR file. The JAR file will be created in the ``target`` directory.
```

To run your Java service, use the following command:

```java -jar target/your-service-1.0.0.jar``` Replace your-service-1.0.0.jar with the name of the JAR file generated by Maven. This command starts your service.

## Prerequisites
Before you get started, make sure you have the following:
- Docker installed on your system.

## Building the Docker Image
To build a Docker image for [Service], follow these steps:
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory (where your Dockerfile is located)
cd /path/to/your/project

# Build the Docker image
docker build -t your-service-image .
```
This command will build a Docker image based on the instructions in your Dockerfile.

## Running the Docker Container
You can run a Docker container from the image using the following command:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 your-service-image
```
This command will start a Docker container running your service and expose it on port 8080.

## Tagging the Image
If you want to tag the image before pushing it to a registry, use the following command:
```bash
docker tag your-service-image username/your-service-image:version
```
Replace `username` with your Docker Hub username (or the name of the registry) and `version` with the desired version.

## Pushing the Image
To push the Docker image to a registry (e.g., Docker Hub), use the following command:
```bash
docker push username/your-service-image:version
```
This command will upload the image to the registry for others to use.

## Pulling the Image
To pull the image from the registry to another system, use the following command:
```bash
docker pull username/your-service-image:version
```
This command will download the image to your local Docker environment.

## Running the Pulled Image
To run the Docker container from the pulled image, use the following command:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 username/your-service-image:version
```
This command will start a container with the pulled image.
